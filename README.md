An interactive project for predicting the ROI of advertising campaigns using an MLP neural network in Python. The model demonstrates feature analysis, training visualization, and an interactive web prototype for business purposes.
## Description
- Uses a dataset of social media advertising campaigns.
- Includes data preprocessing, feature analysis, model building, training, and metric visualization.
- The prototype allows real-time ROI prediction based on user-selected campaign parameters.
## How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. Input campaign parameters in the interactive form to get immediate ROI predictions.
## Visualizations and Results
- Loss and feature importance graphs.
- Interface with sliders and dropdown menus (channel, audience).
- Demonstration of the modelâ€™s business application.
