# Social Media Advertising ROI Prediction (Neural Networks)
An interactive project for predicting the ROI of advertising campaigns using an MLP neural network in Python. The model demonstrates feature analysis, training visualization, and an interactive web prototype for business purposes.
## Description
- Uses a dataset of social media advertising campaigns.
- Includes data preprocessing, feature analysis, model building, training, and metric visualization.
- The prototype allows real-time ROI prediction based on user-selected campaign parameters.
## How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. Input campaign parameters in the interactive form to get immediate ROI predictions.
## Visualizations and Results
- Loss and feature importance graphs.
- Interface with sliders and dropdown menus (channel, audience).
- Demonstration of the model’s business application.
### 1. Project Prompt
I am working on a machine learning project using the Social Media Advertising dataset. My goal is to create a model that predicts the ROI (Return on Investment) for social media ad campaigns before launch, so that businesses can allocate their marketing budgets more efficiently and increase profitability.
- About the data: source, structure, and main features
- Business value: how the predictions help real companies and why it’s useful
- Business logic: how the model decisions link to actual business choices
- Exploratory Data Analysis: key graphs/insights about data distribution, feature impact, and correlations
- Model selection justification: why this model was chosen above others
- Results: metrics, main drivers, and interface/prototype examples
### 2. Detailed EDA Request
"Please provide a thorough walkthrough of EDA: describe and comment on each key visualization (distribution plots, correlations, segment analysis, etc.), identify data patterns, and discuss which features are most influential for ROI prediction."

### 3. Model Selection & Training Discussion
"Explain my process for model selection in detail: what algorithms were tested, how their metrics compared, and why the final model was chosen. Describe the training/validation pipeline, including data splits, main metrics, and how you addressed overfitting or hyperparameter tuning."

### 4. Frontend Development & Page Debugging
I iteratively improved the interactive web page for ROI prediction:
    - Fixed the download button to provide users with a ZIP archive, not a bare CSV, for better browser compatibility and convenience.
    - Updated download paths and instructions based on real-time model outputs.
    - Added detailed interface instructions, clarified error-prone user actions, and ensured the workflow is documented for maintainability.
    - Sought feedback on site structure and usability, resulting in concise HTML/CSS blocks for reproducible results.
